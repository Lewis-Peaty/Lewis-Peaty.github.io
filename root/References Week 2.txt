 Week 1/2 Exercise (Updated for Assignment 1)
 Author: Lewis Peaty
 Date: 2022/03/28
 
 There were a few options in the exercise so I've gone with the following...
 1. @font-face rule
 2. Background image
 3. CSS Flexbox
 4. Animations
 Transitions
 Rounded corners
 Opacity, and
 Borders.

 I used some 3rd party fonts and stock images plus some CSS code tips to get the text animation working. Code/inspiration from the CSS Tricks article has been used to implement the crawl.
